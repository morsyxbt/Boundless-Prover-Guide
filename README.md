# üß©Boundless Prover Guide - The Most Detailed One
The Boundless Prover Node is a computational proving system that participates in the Boundless decentralized proving market. Provers stake USDC bid on computational tasks generate zero-knowledge proofs using GPU acceleration and earn rewards for successful proof generation.

---

## First under how provers work - to know what you are doing : don't skip any line

- Requester posts ZKP request on Boundless (say 10M cycle proof in $5-$10 and 30 min is deadline)
- All provers (say Prover 1-5) see request simultaneously
- Prover 1 locks order at $5 he has to fulfill in 10 mins (LockAndFulfill order)
- Provers 2-5 skip locked order awaiting higher price
  * If Prover 1 attempts proof `Success` Submits in 10 mins, gets paid, no slashing
  * If Failure: Lock expires, Prover 1 slashed

- Post-lock expiry: Order becomes FulfillAfterLockExpire; secondary provers (2-5) attempt proof in remaining 20 mins.
- First secondary prover to submit wins payment; others earn nothing, no slashing.

---

- In all this chaos Boundless has mentioned rewards for primary provers - but i did not come across a single post which says Secondary Provers will be rewarded too - maybe in future they may announce
- Almost all one click nodes (mintair, easy nodes etc) are not able to lock orders even if they do are max secondary orders

* ####  Inject `.env` 

```
source .env
```

----To apply changes then You Have to run this command every time u start the prover 


## Configuring Prover & Broker

#### Single GPU Only:

* Here You will config `mem_limit:` & `cpus`  in the `compose.yml` file according to Your Resources (GPU, Ram & CPU)

```
sudo nano compose.yml
```

1. Now GO to `x-exec-agent-common: &exec-agent-common` section and change:

1.1. `mem_limit:`        How much Ram u want to allocate, dont allocate max:

1.2. `cpus:`            Numbers of Core u want to allocation, u can allocate max if ur core are not doing big stuff: [check core](https://github.com/Mayankgg01/Boundless-Prover-Guide?tab=readme-ov-file#check-number-of-cpu-cores-and-threads)


2. Now scroll down and Go to `gpu_prove_agent0:` & change `mem_limit:` & `cpus:`  Here too: (See ScreenShot)

<img width="2892" height="820" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba890547-a294-405d-8638-4271151aa2c8" />



### 3. Configure Segment Size 

>Here we will change the Segment Size into the `x-exec-agent-common: &exec-agent-common` ...Check the below given Screenshot and edit the `Segment Size` according to your `VRAM` 

<img width="1132" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a25242c-8ae1-499a-a945-60fe2b94b3dd" />

* Now we will add Segment Size in the `.env.broker` 

* Firstly we will copy `.env.broker-template` into `.env.broker`

```
sudo cp .env.broker-template .env.broker
```

* Open it and set `Segment Size` According to your `VRAM` : As same as above step:

```
sudo nano .env.broker
```

* ####  Inject it into broker make changes:

```
source .env.broker
```

>You Have to inject everytime when you are going to run prover/broker

---


## Deposit & Stake Into Marketplace:

>here we will deposit some base mainnet `$USDC` into Boundless marketplcae for staking purpose: and for locking orders. No minimum but you can do around 5$:

1. Inject `.env` first:

```
source .env
```

2. Add boundless CLI into Path

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Deposit Usdc

```
boundless account deposit-stake STAKE_AMOUNT
```

4. Verify Stake

```
boundless account stake-balance
```


---

## Run Bento & Benchmarking Bento

 >Bento: `Bento is the local proving infrastructure. Bento will take requests, prove them and return the result.`


1. Here we will run bento & benchmark our GPUs: 

```
sudo just bento
```

* Make Sure your docker is running in Backgroud:

2. Check the logs

```
just bento logs
```


### Benchmarking Bento

>here we will Benchmark our bento to get to know about our `peak_prove_khz` , which we will use in the broker configuration:

What is `peak_prove_khz` ? --This should correspond to the maximum number of cycles per second (in kHz) your proving backend can operate -

* Inject `.env` first:

```
source .env
```

* Benchmark

```
boundless proving benchmark --request-ids {Order_ID}
```

* Replace `{Order_ID)` from the actual previous order id from official Dashboard: [Get_Order_Id](https://explorer.beboundless.xyz/orders)

>You have to use the `Fulfilled` and `Validated` order IDs: (check below Screenshot)

<img width="2184" height="301" alt="image_2025-07-19_18-40-01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce2a7dd9-416d-4a39-b8f5-69385476c130" />



* Look at the below image, U can see `peak_prove_khz = 333` , the prover is estimated to handle ~333,000 cycles per second (~333 khz).

* We will use this in upcoming broker config file: 

* U can test many times to get the accurate of it:

<img width="2559" height="454" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-19 184051" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3e91fa-e62d-4d9b-a792-8a7f2b781167" />


* You have to wait until it done: It can take time: Depends on your choosen `Cycles` in the Order: 

---



## Broker Configuration

>The Broker is a service that runs within the Bento proving stack. Responsible for market interactions including bidding on jobs, locking them, issuing job requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments onchain


* Here You will download my updated `Broker.toml` file: But you all need to configure it manually according to your specs and resources: And u have to play with these configuration to make your broker `Competitive`:


1. Install `Broker.toml`

```
cd boundless
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayankgg01/Boundless-Prover-Guide/refs/heads/main/broker.toml -O broker.toml
```

2. Open `Broker.toml` 

```
sudo nano broker.toml
```

>Now we will make Changes in it according to our system and resources: 

>‚ùóMention all the necessary configs which u have to change: Read all them very politely and change your config according to them:


### 1. `mcycle_price`:

* What it means:

   This sets how much you're charging per million cycles (mcycle) when bidding on proving jobs.  This is one of the inputs to decide the minimum price to accept for a request.

* Tip: Decreasing the `mcycle_price` would help your Broker to bid at lower prices for proofs. So Keep it low

* Ex. You can set it like or lower too: "0.000000000000001" 

### 2. `mcycle_price_stake_token`

* What it means:
     
     Defines which token you're pricing in (usdc) . This is used to determine the minimum price to accept an order when paid in staking tokens (usdc).

* Tip: You can reduce it or increse according to u: You can keep as well: `0.000001`

### 3. `priority_requestor_addresses`

* What it means:

     Priority requestor addresses that can bypass the mcycle limit and max input size limit. We alraedy set 4 official `priority_requestor_addresses` in our file:


### 4. `peak_prove_khz`

* What it means:

     This is your GPU's maximum proving speed, in thousands of cycles per second.

* How to set:

>You alraedy test it and got your `peak_prove_khz` here: [Benchmarking Bento](https://github.com/Mayankgg01/Boundless-Prover-Guide?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarking-bento)

* Edit your `peak_prove_khz` in `broker.toml`

### 5. `max_mcycle_limit` 

* What it means:

     This limits the maximum job size (in mcycles) you‚Äôll accept. `(1 mcycle= 1 million cycles)` Avoids jobs that are too heavy for your hardware. Orders with cycles more than the set parameter will be spikked


* Tip: You have to change this according to your System: Prover with limited resources should reduce this number cause u cant complete this big order: So If your system or u have multiple gpu then set high: like 4000-5000

* 1 GPU users can set it like 1000-2000

### 6. `min_deadline` 

* What it means:

     This is a minimum number of blocks before the requested job expiration that Broker will attempt to lock a job.

>By setting the min deadline, your prover won't accept requests with a deadline less than that.

* How to set:

>Example: min_deadline = 300 means only take jobs that expire in >5 minutes.

>If your prover is fast and stable, you can reduce to 200 to get more jobs.

### 7. `max_concurrent_proofs`

* What it means:

    How many proving jobs your broker can run at the same time. When the numbers of running proving jobs reaches that limit, the system will pause and wait for them to get finished instead of locking more orders. 

* How to set:

>Set this based on your GPU + CPU power.

>Dont set it above 2 if you are on single GPU, If you're running multiple GPUs, you can increase this


### 8. lockin_priority_gas

* What it means:

     Minimum gas fee (in wei) to send priority lock-in txs. Increasing it to consume more gas to outrun other bidders

* How to set:

 >Example: `lockin_priority_gas` = 3000000000000 means 3000 Gwei. (0.000003 eth)

 >This is important for fast inclusion onchain.

 >Keep between 2000-4000 Gwei to stay competitive.

* Web to Calculate it: www.alchemy.com/gwei-calculator


### Check-out official Docs for more info regarding Broker Configuration: [Official-docs](https://docs.beboundless.xyz/provers/broker#settings-in-brokertoml)

---

## Stop the `bento`

>We will stop the `bento` to run the broker & applying config changes:

```
sudo just bento down
```

### Install `foundry` before running the broker

* >It will prevent you from an Error which will come at building broker:

```
sudo curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash -s -- --skip-confirm
```

```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```
foundryup
forge --version
```

```
forge install Arachnid/solidity-stringutils
```

---

## Start The BrokerüöÄ

1. Inject `.env` 

```
source .env
```

2. Run Prover

```
sudo just broker
```

>Running a broker with `just` will also start the `Bento`  through docker compose.

3. Check logs

>If u are doing in Local Pc then check your Docker Desktop that all 11 containers are running: 

>Check the `Broker` containers Logs:

* If cloud GPU then follow:

```
docker ps
```

* Broker Logs

```
just broker logs
```
